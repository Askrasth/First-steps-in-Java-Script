// JAVA SCRIPT



alert('this is a js sintax');

alert(' this is a java script page')

document.getElementById('sec1').innerHTML="The <i>Java Script</i> is an interresting <b>Programing language</b> to learn";

document.getElementById('sec2').innerHTML="We could say that, <i> Html, Css </i> and <i> Java script</i> are the <b> Big power trio </b> of <b> Front - end </b> web development.";



console.log("this is another output of information with js")


let age = 18
if (age >= 18){
console.log('you are an adult')
}else{
    console.log('you are an adolescent');
}


let note = 95

if (note >= 60 ){
    console.log('You are approved')
}else{
    console.log('You were rejected')
}


document.write('did i get it ?')

alert('VICTOOOOOOOOOOOORY AND GLORY WE SHALL CELEBRATE')

document.write(' Finally i learned how to use <i> document.write</i>! Now i know it was the letter <b> W </b> which was my challenge at this code line. The w must be <u> simple </u> and not as <u> capslock.</u>  ')

document.write(' So, these are the four forms of outputting information: <u> alert, console.log, document.getElementById </u> and <u> documet.write</u>')

document.write(' thats just the begining of my js journey.')

document.write(' i liked this so much that im using this sintax a lot.')

document.getElementById('sec3').innerHTML="Coding is not hard. Just face the challenges and overcome it. Each code line mastered and each challenge passed is a new level and a new step ahead. Lets go bro to the end on this journey.";
